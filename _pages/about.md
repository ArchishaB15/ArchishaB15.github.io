Hi! I'm Archisha Bodhmage.
I am a Computer Engineering student at Virginia Tech, expected to graduate in 2028. I am interested in digital systems, embedded hardware, and applying engineering principles to practical problems.

I have experience working in team-based environments through both academic projects and research-oriented activities. I am currently involved with the IDPro Research Team, contributing to the SMART (Software Managed and Automated Residential Toolkit) project, where I assist with hardware-related development and prototyping.

In addition to technical work, I have held customer-facing roles that strengthened my communication, organization, and teamwork skills.
